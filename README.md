# Operating-Systems-Game ðŸŽ®

## A simple game in C++ to learn more about threads ðŸ§µ and semaphores ðŸš¦! 

### :books: SSC0140 - Operating Systems I (USP - ICMC)

- A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization, consisting of a program counter, a stack, and a set of registers, (and a thread ID.)

- Traditional processes have a single thread of control.

- A semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system.

- In this game, we will use those concepts to create a really fun mechanic! ðŸ˜Š


### How to Install
- Dowload the file

- Run `g++ blabla main.cpp` 

- Type `./programm` and the game is about to start!


### How to Play
- 'Who Wants to be a Milionaire' is a classic game, where the player must get all the questions right to win!

- The player has 30 seconds to answer each question. Just type the answer and the timer stops.

- If the player runs out of time or answers incorrectly, then he lost everything! ðŸ˜¢

- If the player doesn't know the answer, he can type 'E' and skip it, this way, he doens't get any points but also is not out of the game.

- If the player answers correctly all the 20 questions, then he is the big winner! ðŸ¥³
